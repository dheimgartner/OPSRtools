\title{Select a Model in a Stepwise Algorithm}
\usage{
opsr_select(
  object,
  pseq = seq(0.9, 0.1, by = -0.1),
  log = new.env(),
  verbose = TRUE,
  verbose.kfold = FALSE,
  loss = c("kfold", "aic", "bic", "lrt"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{"opsr"}.}

\item{pseq}{sequence of p-value thresholds (each of which is passed as \code{pval}
to \code{\link{opsr_step}}).}

\item{log}{environment to keep track of changes to \code{object} (in particular
variables being eliminated).}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE}, prints working information during computation.}

\item{verbose.kfold}{passed as \code{verbose} to \code{\link{opsr_kfold}}.}

\item{loss}{The loss function for model comparison. Can be abbreviated.
See 'Details' section for more information.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link{opsr_select}}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"opsr.kfold"}.
}
\description{
Iteratively calls \code{\link{opsr_step}} and compares the resulting model to the
current winner (as evaluated by a selected loss function).
}
\details{
Currently four loss functions are available which can be selected via the
\code{loss} argument. The loss is then computed for the two models to be compared
and a winner is selected. Can be one of \code{"kfold"} (see also \code{\link{opsr_kfold}}),
\code{"aic"} for AIC, \code{"bic"} for BIC and \code{"lrt"} for a likelihood ratio test.
